1. Objective:
Analyze historical data of Premier League teams and players to predict the performance of teams for the upcoming 2023-2024 season.

2. Data Sources Used:

Player statistics from the 2020-09-24.csv dataset.
Match results from the premier-league-matches.csv dataset.
Premier League results from the epl_results_2022-23.csv dataset.
3. Data Exploration & Cleaning:

Explored datasets to understand the structure, columns, and potential discrepancies.
Handled missing values and standardized team naming conventions for accurate data merging.
Aggregated data to derive team-level metrics such as total goals scored, total assists, and average age.
4. Data Analysis:

Calculated correlation between player metrics (like goals, assists, age) and team performance metrics (like home goals, away goals).
Visualized the correlation matrix using a heatmap to identify significant relationships.
Found that age had a negative correlation with goals, suggesting younger players tend to score more.
5. Data Merging:

Merged player statistics with match results to associate team performance with individual player metrics.
Further merged with Premier League results to create a comprehensive dataset for modeling.
6. Predictive Modeling:

Utilized a Linear Regression model to predict the points for the 2023-2024 season based on team metrics.
Split the data into training and test sets for model validation.
Evaluated the model's performance using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric.
Predicted points for each team for the 2023-2024 season, with teams like Liverpool, Arsenal, and Manchester City expected to be top performers.
7. Key Takeaways:

Data-driven insights can provide valuable foresight into team performance in upcoming seasons.
Player metrics, especially age, goals, and assists, play a crucial role in determining team success.
Predictive modeling, while not foolproof, offers a quantitative basis for discussions on team performance.
8. Recommendations & Future Work:

Incorporate more granular data such as player transfers, injuries, and managerial changes to refine predictions.
Explore more sophisticated models and feature engineering techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
Consider other factors like team morale, fan support, and financial health for a holistic analysis.
